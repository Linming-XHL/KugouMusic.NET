# Sonnet language data

Ordinary builds use the checked-in binary resources offline. No Python,
download, JSON reflection serializer, or tokenizer runtime is needed by the app.

Regenerate from pinned upstream sources:

```sh
python3 tools/generate-sonnet-language-data.py
```

The equivalent opt-in build property is `GenerateSonnetLanguageData=true`.
For offline generation, pass `--source-root DIRECTORY` containing the pinned
`jieba/` and `tinysegmenter/` checkouts. SHA-256 is checked before reading data;
upstream Python is parsed as literal data, never executed.

The generator pins source revisions and hashes, and prints the unique dictionary
entry count and runtime data size. Generation rejects a total greater than 8 MiB
without pruning entries. Duplicate dictionary spellings use the last source
entry; probabilities are normalized over the resulting unique entries.

- `Chinese.bin`: `SNL1`, little-endian count / maximum UTF-16 length / maximum
  UTF-8 length / block count, double log total frequency, int block offsets.
  Each block has up to 32 lexically sorted UTF-8 words. Entries contain unsigned
  varint common-prefix and suffix byte lengths, suffix bytes, float log word
  probability, and a byte coarse word class. Only this byte array is retained;
  searches reconstruct one block into a temporary buffer. DAG scanning appends
  one complete grapheme at a time to a reusable UTF-8 prefix buffer and narrows
  the matching sorted-entry interval. An empty interval stops that scan; terminal
  entries feed the existing maximum-probability route directly. No persistent
  trie, new language resource format, or regenerated dictionary is required.
- `ChineseHmm.bin`: `SNH1`, four double initial probabilities and sixteen double
  transition probabilities in BMES order, followed by four sorted emission
  tables (int count, int Unicode scalar / double probability pairs).
- `Japanese.bin`: `SNJ1`, int bias and table count, then TinySegmenter feature
  tables with UTF-8 names/keys (varint lengths) and int weights.

Word boundaries and original offsets are independent of lyric timestamps.
Clipped/missing and internally subdivided timings are marked estimated;
unaltered source-tag endpoints remain available as reliable pause anchors.
Unknown Chinese emission characters stay intact. Chinese is the default for
ambiguous all-Han text; `SonnetLine.LanguageHint` can override routing.

The resources and implementation are designed for AOT, but generation and
ordinary compilation do not establish NativeAOT or visual-quality validation.
